During development, SbC allows for prototyping data processing algorithms and carrying out virtual commissioning. During production, SbC allows to implement controllers which have to cope with detailed knowledge about the asset itself and/or its environment as basis for calculations or simulations. This is the starting point e.g. for the realization of intelligent systems which need to evaluate decision alternatives or asset administration shells exposing highly detailed knowledge (including its behavior) about the asset to the digital world. The major benefits of SbC are the quick and seamless transition between virtual and hybrid scenarios without the need to change the models involved (only redirect some connections), the full access to the original controller implementation during real-world operation and the possibility to use the simulator infrastructure to implement controllers",
